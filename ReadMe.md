# VSCode Stream Deck Plugin

## Summary

This plugin is a prototype for a Visual Studio Code plugin for the Elgato Stream Deck. It allows you to control Visual Studio Code from your Stream Deck.

This plugin is a work in progress and is not yet ready for general use, it also requires a beta build of the stream deck cli.

## Installing

## Developing

You will need the Stream Deck SDK to build this plugin. You can install it via npm from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elgato/cli). Make sure you are running NodeJS 20.x or better otherwise your version of the Stream Deck SDK you'll be running will be too old. You want version 0.2.x or preferably 0.3.x currently in beta.

```bash
streamdeck dev
```
